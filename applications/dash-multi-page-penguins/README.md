# demo-dash-multi-page-penguins

Dash provides two approaches for building multi page dash apps:

1. Using the [Dash Pages](https://dash.plotly.com/urls#dash-pages) feature (released on June 7, 2022 with version 2.5). See the example in [using-dash-pages](using-dash-pages). I recommend that you use this approach unless you need to use a version of Dash less than 2.5.
2. Using `dcc.Location`. See the example in [using-dcc-location](using-dcc-location).
